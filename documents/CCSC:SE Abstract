Title: MACK Pages: A Personalized About Me Webpage
## Presenter(s): Ayesha, Keyvan, Mohfez, and Carri
Faculty Advisors: Cengiz Gunay, Rahaf Barakat 
Abstract: Mack Pages is an all-about me website created by Georgia Gwinnett College (GGC) 
Information Technology students Mohfez Rahman, Ayesha Syeda, Carri Waller, and Keyvan Shabani.
The students are part of the Technology Ambassador Program (TAP) which allows members to play with technologies and build projects for the community. 
The community consists of anyone from middle school to college students. To connect with these students Mack Pages allows everyone to have their own 
personalized about me page and have their own QR code for obtaining the website. The students who solve the steps and host their website on GitHub, 
will be given their personal NFC tag that will contain their website. The website will have an API that calls for the quote of the day, giving the students a chance
to learn about what APIs are. They will also get the chance to manipulate with HTML/CSS code. The students will be given 5-step blueprint website that they will alter.
