# MACK Pages
## Description:
Our project is a simple all-about-you page that can be customized with your choices. It is a 5-step diy cover page website that can be obtained with a QR code or NFC chip to share with others. The technologies we are planning to use are Github, QR codes and NFCs. We also have used an API to generate quotes with every page refresh. The target of this project is for users to get introduced to QR code, NFCs, usage of API, and utilize HTML/CSS.
